            <strong>Software Engineer</strong> (2016 - 2017)
            <p>
              At Sandvine, I was tasked with the development of many of the
              systems within the hardware abstraction layer, mainly the
              development of drivers. My most notable work was to refactor the
              infrastructure responsible for reporting sensors data for all the
              voltage regulators and power supplies. Previously, the system
              wasn’t thread safe, as many different threads could read and clear
              sensors without any synchronisation and this resulted in
              unpredictable performance of this critical system. To address this
              problem, I implemented a caching infrastructure that would have
              exclusive access to the hardware.

              <p>
                The goal of this project is to make a platform that I can use to
                implement what I am learning in an online course on computer
                vision, as well as expand upon the concepts of control theory
                and autonomous robotics that I previously learned at school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since I want the robot to perform tasks using computer vision, I
                selected the Raspberry Pi to act as the brain. The other
                microcontroller I have is an arduino, but it wouldn’t be
                practical to attempt any image processing on this platform. It
                is also favourable to use the Pi, since most navigating and path
                planning algorithms would most likely be more than the Arduino
                could handle.
              </p>

                />So far, I have worked on the mechanical design which is now
                complete. The robot uses 2 stepper motors as its means of
                locomotion. Typically, small robots like this use simple DC
                motors as they are far more efficient, don’t require any power
                when sitting idle, and have a wider range of rpm. However, this
                robot will be used as an autonomous platform; thus, the
                displacement information provided by the “ticks” of the stepper
                motor will be very useful. DC motors can accomplish this if they
                have an encoder attached to them, but this increases the price
                significantly. You could approximate the distance travelled and
                use other sensors to correct for the error, however, since there
                will be slippage, I am going to be doing this even with the
                stepper. The only difference is that the stepper estimates will
                be more accurate. Another consideration is that stepper motors
                aren’t nearly as good at acceleration or variable loads, but
                this robot doesn't need either of these since the load will be
                relatively constant and won’t require large acceleration.
              </p>
              <p>
                To drive the motors I am using TI’s DRV8823. It’s a simple
                driver that can operate 2 stepper motors (has 4 H-bridges). In
                order to communicate with it, the Raspberry Pi uses its SPI bus.
                An advantage of the SPI bus is that the number of wires is
                greatly reduced, as you can see below, when comparing the SPI
                driver to a DIR/STEP driver.

              <p>
                The trade-off is that a 16bit SPI transaction takes much longer
                than toggling a couple GPIOs, but the timescale of this is
                negligible as compared to the response time of a stepper motor.
                I opted to make a custom board for the driver, since I enjoy
                designing PCBs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The robot’s sensory information is provided via 3 different
                sensors. An ultrasonic range finder is used for collision
                avoidance, and can be used in conjunction with a camera or on
                its own for crude environment mapping. A simple IMU, comprised
                of 3 axis gyroscope, 3 axis accelerometer, and 3 axis
                magnetometer, is used in the control loop to provide the robot’s
                balancing capability. It will also be used in conjunction with
                the stepper motor’s displacement data to maintain accurate
                positioning. The system will most likely use a kalman filter to
                achieve its dead reckoning navigation. Finally, the robot will
                have a camera to perform various computer vision tasks using
                openCV.

                The objective of this project was to create a device that could
                retrieve a skier (lego man) stranded on the opposite side of a
                mountain (a wooden ramp with a 45&deg; incline). The device
                needed to autonomously navigate the course, find and retrieve
                the lego, and then return to the starting point.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our solution was to make a robot with tracks that could climb
                the ramp. However, we were faced with a couple of problems.
                First, the 45&deg; angle was too steep to climb with normal
                means of traction. Second, without proper guides, the robot
                would fall off the ramp. So, we devised an ingenious solution
                that would solve both problems.

                  />This is a frontal view of the wheel design. It has sewing
                  needles protruding from the inner wheel (smaller diameter) to
                  give maximum grip into the wooden ramp, and has a ridge that
                  allows a belt to transfer power from the rear wheels to the
                  ones in the front. The outer wheel (larger diameter) is used
                  to protect the spikes from being dulled when on the concrete
                  floor, and serves as a guide when going up the ramp. The outer
                  wheel also has a ridge to add a rubber tire to increase
                  traction against smooth concrete. The following video shows
                  that the wheel design worked well, and the robot successfully
                  climbed the ramp.

                The second part of the challenge was to devise a method of
                capturing the lego and holding it. The lego was placed on a 1
                inch tall wooden platform, so we needed a way of climbing onto
                that as well. We, once again, decided to have a single design to
                acomplish several tasks. Our design was inspired by bobcat
                bulldozer; these small machines often use their shovel not only
                for it’s obvious function, but also to lift itself above
                obstacles. To ensure that the lego would fall into the shovel we
                added a sweeping arm to knock the lego into place.

                />The final challenge was to add a sensor that would enable this
                robot to operate autonomously. We needed a way to have the robot
                find its location relative to the course. The simplest way was
                to use the largest obstacle in the course &mdash; the large wall
                separating both sides of the course. By using a simple distance
                measurement to this wall we established the robot's orientation
                and distance relative to its plane. Scanning till the edge of
                the wall finalized its position. To improve accuracy with cheap
                and noisy sensors, we used linear regression to identify the
                orientation of the wall. To help reduce the the error in our
                sensors, the laser range sensors were mounted to a panning
                servo, as moving the entire robot would introduce more error
                into the measurements. This identified the robot’s positioning
                at the time of the scan, but between scans, we implemented dead
                reckoning with the use of a gyroscope, accelerometer, and
                empirical characterisation of the drive servos to update the
                robot’s location tracking. The panning sensor was equipped with
                a long range sensor used for positioning relative to the course
                and a short range sensor used to determine the position of the
                lego as the robot approached it.

                &mdash; 3 translational degrees and 3 rotational. Typically, to
                control these 6 degrees, two joysticks are used, each offering
                control over 3 degrees. However, this isn’t as intuitive as
                manipulating the object directly.

                To simplify the problem, we chose to have different mechanisms
                to read the two separate types of motion. The first was the
                translational movements; we used a gantry system to track the
                input. In order for the system to be operated smoothly, we used
                linear rails which are used for CNC machines.

                What set this design apart from other 6 degrees of freedom
                controllers, was the ability to choose between continuous motion
                like with a mouse, or return to centre motion like with a
                joystick. The former is useful when controlling a robotic arm
                that has limited range, the latter can be used when controlling
                something like a submarine which can go forward indefinitely. To
                switch between these two options, you only needed to flip the
                black tabs on each axis, as seen in the image below. The tab has
                springs on either side which push the axis back to its centre
                once the user releases the tension, like a joystick.

                The rotational motions were much more difficult to track.
                Although, it is simple to implement a device with 3 degrees of
                rotational movement, we wanted the device to feel as though you
                were simply manipulating an object in your hand. To do this,
                your hand would have to be at the centre of all three axes of
                rotation. So, we settled on a ball and socket type mechanism.
                The ball is hollowed out in order for the hand to be at the
                centre of rotation. The exterior of the socket is triangular,
                and each edge of the triangle has a spring connected to the
                moving part. This gives it the same return-to-center behaviour
                that the linear axis can achieve.

                That completed the mechanical system. However, in order for this
                to be a controller the system needed sensors to convert the
                user's motion to something meaningful for the device. Most
                controllers use magnets as a transducer, but thumbsticks have a
                very small range of motion that can be captured by a single pair
                of hall effect sensors and a small magnet. This was feasible for
                the axis of rotation, but the translational axis required a
                different solution. In order to cover the entire range of
                motion, we used a series of hall effect sensors that would stay
                stationary and the magnet would move relative to its axis. As
                you can see in the image below, each of the green boards has a
                hall effect and they are all spaced such that as one sensor is
                about to lose the magnet, another begins detecting it.

                The device needs a controller to read the sensors and transmit
                the data. We opted to make a custom circuit board since it would
                better suit our needs, and would be a great experience. Being
                the only one with hardware design experience, I was the sole
                designer of the controller board. Since there were too many
                sensors to have an ADC for each, and cable management would be
                difficult on a device with so many moving parts, we used a MUX
                in each translational axis and one for the rotational axis. The
                TI MSP430 was selected as the mircocontroller, partly because it
                had good documentation, but mostly because TI gave free samples!
                You can see the board schematic below.

                Designing the board layout was far more complicated than we
                amticipated, as the board needed to be fairly small and
                discrete. To make matters worse, at the time of designing the
                board, we couldn’t decide whether we would use hall effect
                sensors, which required analog signals, or optical sensors,
                which used SPI. So, the board needed to support both in case we
                changed our minds. The board had connectors dedicated to each of
                the two options. In the end, we selected the hall effect
                sensors. As you can see below in the image of the board, this is
                a dense layout and required 4 layers.

                The device is much smaller than you would think based on the
                image; the entire mechanism fits within 10x10 inches. This was
                done because the controller is meant to take similar real estate
                on a desk as a mouse pad would.
